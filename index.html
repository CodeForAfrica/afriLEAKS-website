              <p>AfriLEAKS allows you to leak confidential documents of public interest. We've designed the system to help
              you share these materials while protecting your own identity, making it very hard to identify you as the
              source of the leak.</p>

              <p>AfriLEAKS is run by an alliance of African news organisations that are committed to speaking truth to
              power. You can send us documents and select which of our member organisations should perform an
              investigation. This site also helps you to stay in touch and answer further questions without revealing
              your name or contact information.</p>

              <h1>How to leak confidential documents</h1>
              <p>If you have information about issues which should be investigated, share them with one of AfriLEAKS's news
              partners using this site. Consider that concrete information and evidence, such as source documents, gives
              a journalist more to work with and increases the likelihood that your issue gets taken up.</p>
              <h2>Protect your identity</h2>
              <p>Leaking sensitive information involves risks. There are both social and technical risks that threaten your
              anonymity. At the same time, there are measures you can take to protect yourself. See 'Your Security' for
              more details.</p>
              <h2>Who should receive your information?</h2>
              <p>The press checks those in power and exposes misconduct or abuse of power. The media has the resources to
              bring issues into the public light. Journalists are professionals who investigate, ask critical questions,
              and ensure all parties involved are asked about their side of the story. Furthermore, they work for mass
              media (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, or television programs) through which they can make their
              research public.</p>
